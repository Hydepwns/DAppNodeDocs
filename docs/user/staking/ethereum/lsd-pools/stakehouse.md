### **Stakehouse Overview**

Stakehouse’s mission is to bring the benefits of ETH staking to the mainstream user. To do this Blockswap developed a public benefit infrastructure favoring solo stakers. Those who are most important to the Ethereum blockchain now have access to the Stakehouse middle layer which is like ETH staking with superpowers. Not only are solo stakers empowered, but anybody who touches staked ETH or its peripheries can benefit from a protocol that creates multichain ETH without a bridge, doesn’t pool users’ assets, doesn’t collect a commission, doesn’t require a particular node, and doesn’t use an oracle.

### **Package Key Features**

1. **Integration with Web3Signer:** When being a node operator, you can import your keystores into Web3Signer and select Stakehouse under the "Staking Protocol" field. Web3Signer takes care of the rest!
  
2. **Staking Inclusion:** Users can run a validator for 4 ETH or provide liquidity with as little as 0.001 ETH, to earn Ethereum consensus rewards. The users of LSD Networks can range from DAOs to node operators to general users who have ETH to stake.

### **First Steps to become a Node Runner with Stakehouse and Dappnode**

1. **Setup your LSD:**
   - Go to [Stakehouse's LSD wizard](https://lsd.joinstakehouse.com/) and click "Deposit" under "Node Operator".
   - Follow the steps to [generate your key](https://help.joinstakehouse.com/en/articles/6597493-how-do-i-generate-my-validator-keys-using-wagyu-keygen-mainnet-testnet).
   - Make the initial 4 ETH deposit.

2. **Import your keystore file into Web3Signer:**
   - When you import your keystore, make sure you select Stakehouse under "Staking protocol". This will automatically set your Fee Recipient address and point it to your LSD.
   - Pay special attention to this, since failing to properly configure the Fee Recipient may incur in penalties for the Node Runner.

Staking, though lucrative, also comes with inherent risks. Stakehouse simplifies the process but doesn't eliminate the risks. It's essential to conduct thorough research and always prioritize safety.
